# Model Evaluation Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the evaluation of a reinforcement learning model trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The model was tested in a custom environment (`OT2Env`) with PyBullet for physics simulation. The evaluation used a fixed goal position to measure the model's performance.

## Execution Summary
### Environment Setup
- **Environment**: OT2Env (Custom Wrapper v2)
- **Physics Engine**: PyBullet
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU
- **OpenGL Version**: 4.6.0 (NVIDIA 566.07)

### Evaluation Parameters
- **Fixed Goal Position**: `[0.1, 0.1, 0.2]` (in meters)
- **Number of Episodes**: 10
- **Maximum Steps per Episode**: 1000

### Results
| Metric             | Value       |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Avg Accuracy**   | 0.0008 m    |
| **Std Dev**        | 0.0001 m    |
| **Avg Steps**      | 57.10       |

- **Avg Accuracy**: The average distance between the model's final position and the fixed goal position across all episodes was **0.8 mm**.
- **Std Dev**: The model demonstrated highly consistent performance, with a standard deviation of **0.1 mm**.
- **Avg Steps**: The model required an average of **57 steps** to complete each episode, indicating efficiency in navigating to the goal.

## Execution Logs
1. **PyBullet Initialization**:
   - Started threads for physics simulation and rendering.
   - Successfully utilized NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU for computation.

2. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Model path: `C:\Users\jimal\OneDrive - BUas\Pictures\CkearML\ClearMl\model.zip`
   - Successfully evaluated over 10 episodes.

3. **Thread Management**:
   - Simulation threads terminated cleanly after execution.

## Observations
- **High Precision**: The model achieved exceptional accuracy with minimal deviation.
- **Efficiency**: The low average step count suggests the model effectively optimizes its actions.
- **Stability**: Consistent performance metrics demonstrate reliable behavior across episodes.

---

## Recommendations
- Further evaluate the model with dynamic or random goal positions to test generalization capabilities.
- Compare this model's performance with additional trained models to identify areas for improvement.
- Visualize the model's trajectory and learning curves for better insights.

## Next Steps
1. Document results in the README file (provided below).
2. Save results to a structured file (e.g., JSON or CSV) for future reference.
3. Add visualizations to analyze performance metrics further.
